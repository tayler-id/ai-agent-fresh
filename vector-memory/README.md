# Vector Memory Module (Planned)

This directory will contain the implementation for semantic memory retrieval using a vector database.

## Goals

- Store embeddings for memory entries, code snippets, and documentation.
- Enable fast, semantic search for relevant context to feed into the LLM.
- Support integration with local or cloud vector DBs (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate, Pinecone).

## Initial Scaffold

1. **vectorMemory.js**  
   - Core logic for storing, retrieving, and searching vectorized memory.
   - Abstraction for plugging in different vector DB backends.

2. **embeddingProvider.js**  
   - Utility for generating embeddings from text using OpenAI, HuggingFace, or local models.

3. **vector-memory.config.json**  
   - Configuration for DB backend, embedding model, and connection details.

4. **test/**  
   - Directory for unit and integration tests for vector memory operations.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Research and select initial vector DB backend (default: Chroma or local).
- [ ] Implement embedding provider (OpenAI or HuggingFace).
- [ ] Scaffold vectorMemory.js with add, search, and delete operations.
- [ ] Integrate with agent context window for semantic retrieval.
- [ ] Document usage and configuration.

All progress and design decisions will be tracked in the Memory Bank and this README.
