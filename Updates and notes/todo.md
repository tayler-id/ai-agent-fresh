# MCP Client Implementation Todo List

## Review and Analysis
- [x] Review existing mcpClient.js implementation
- [x] Review agent.js integration with MCP client
- [x] Review mcp-config.json structure
- [x] Understand current transport mechanisms (SSE and stdio)
- [x] Clarify requirements with user

## Design
- [x] Identify issues in current implementation
- [x] Design architecture for server-agnostic MCP client
- [x] Define error handling and retry mechanisms
- [x] Plan for extensibility to support additional transport protocols
- [x] Design for compatibility with standard MCP implementations

## Implementation
- [x] Fix issues in current mcpClient.js implementation
- [x] Enhance error handling and logging
- [x] Implement robust connection management
- [x] Add support for automatic reconnection
- [x] Ensure proper resource cleanup
- [x] Add comprehensive validation for server configurations

## Testing
- [x] Create test cases for different transport types
- [x] Test with sample server implementations
- [x] Validate error handling and recovery
- [x] Test performance under various conditions

## Documentation
- [x] Document architecture and design decisions
- [x] Create usage examples for different server types
- [x] Document configuration options
- [x] Provide troubleshooting guide
