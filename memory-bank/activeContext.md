# Active Context: Advanced Chat UI Development

## Current Status: Advanced Chat UI Foundational Setup (May 13, 2025)

- **Objective:** Initiated development of a new, full-featured chat UI (`src/advanced-chat-ui/`) as per user request, building upon the existing agent's backend capabilities.
- **Progress:**
    1.  Successfully set up a Next.js application (`src/advanced-chat-ui/`) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router.
    2.  Installed and integrated the Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`, `@ai-sdk/openai`).
    3.  Created a basic chat page (`src/app/chat/page.tsx`) using the `useChat` hook.
    4.  Implemented a backend API route (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`) that connects to the DeepSeek LLM (via OpenAI provider compatibility) and streams responses.
    5.  Added initial URL detection (GitHub/YouTube) to the API route, modifying the system prompt for LLM acknowledgment. This functionality has been manually verified by the user.
    6.  Troubleshot and resolved several issues:
        *   NPM cache misconfiguration in the main project.
        *   Module import errors for Vercel AI SDK components (`StreamingTextResponse`, `OpenAI` provider instantiation).
        *   Module resolution issues for importing `src/github.js` into the nested Next.js app, currently worked around by copying `github.js` to `src/advanced-chat-ui/src/lib/` and adding `glob` as a local dependency to `advanced-chat-ui`.
- **Outcome:** The foundational elements of the `advanced-chat-ui` are in place. LanceDB integration for semantic search (`task-95`) has been successfully tested with both Webpack (after configuration changes) and Turbopack.
- **LanceDB Integration Status (`task-95` - May 14, 2025):**
    -   **Webpack:** Resolved `Module parse failed` error using `serverExternalPackages: ['@lancedb/lancedb']` and `webpack.externals` in `next.config.ts`. LanceDB is functional.
    -   **Turbopack:** Successfully tested. The `serverExternalPackages: ['@lancedb/lancedb']` setting in `next.config.ts` appears sufficient for Turbopack to handle the LanceDB native module. The previous `Error: could not resolve "@lancedb/lancedb-darwin-arm64"` did **not** reappear.
    -   **Note:** Turbopack still warns `⚠ Webpack is configured while Turbopack is not, which may cause problems.` This needs monitoring but isn't currently blocking LanceDB.
- **Task Status:** Implementation of `task-95` (Integrate LanceDB Semantic Search in Chat API) can proceed.

## Immediate Next Steps & Roadmap Focus (Updated - May 14, 2025)

**IMPORTANT: YouTube URL Analysis Testing Paused for New Feature Request (May 14, 2025)**
- Testing for `task-107` ("Test YouTube URL Analysis in Chat UI" as part of `req-25`) has been paused.
- Test Case 1 (Valid YouTube URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txzOIGulUIQ`) was successfully completed.
- Test Case 2 (Invalid YouTube URL / No Transcript) and Test Case 3 (Follow-up Conversation & Recall) were **not** performed due to a user request to prioritize a new feature.
- **Immediate Next Step:** Gather requirements for the new feature requested by the user.

With LanceDB showing compatibility with both Webpack and Turbopack (using `serverExternalPackages`), the focus can return to direct integration and feature development in the `advanced-chat-ui` *once the new feature request is clarified and potentially addressed*.

1.  **Advanced Chat UI - LanceDB Integration & Enhancements (PREVIOUS HIGHEST PRIORITY - Now pending new feature discussion):**
    *   **Objective:** Fully integrate LanceDB semantic search into the `api/chat` route. Ensure search results are correctly processed and used to augment LLM context (RAG).
    *   Refine the logging for LanceDB search results in `route.ts` to be more concise if needed.
    *   Proceed with `task-95` and related UI feature development that depends on semantic search.
    *   Monitor for any side effects from the Turbopack warning regarding Webpack configuration. If issues arise, consult Turbopack documentation for specific configurations (`https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo`).

2.  **Research AI Agent Architectures & Native Dependency Solutions (Adjusted Priority):**
    *   While the immediate blocker for LanceDB is resolved, this research (`task-98`, `task-99`, `task-100` of `req-23`) remains valuable for long-term best practices, handling other potential native dependencies, and understanding Turbopack-specific configurations beyond `serverExternalPackages`. It can proceed at a moderate priority or be deferred if UI development takes precedence.

3.  **Advanced Chat UI - Other Foundational Enhancements:**
    *   Further integration of GitHub analysis and other features can now proceed more confidently, pending new feature discussion.

4.  **Shared Code Management Strategy:**
    *   This remains relevant and may be informed by the research into architectural patterns.

5.  **Memory Visualization UI - Backend Integration (`src/memory-ui/`):**
    *   This task remains important but is secondary to resolving the core architecture for semantic search and new feature discussion.

6.  **Local Path Analysis Bug (CLI Agent):**
    *   This task is also secondary to the new research initiative and new feature discussion.

7.  **Refine Core Agent Workflows, Error Handling, Prompt Engineering (Ongoing):**
    *   These are continuous improvement tasks.

## Ongoing Documentation & Knowledge Management
-   The current research findings and subsequent architectural decisions will be thoroughly documented in the Memory Bank.
-   The Knowledge Graph will be updated to reflect any significant architectural changes.

---

The project's current trajectory is to proceed with full LanceDB integration into the `advanced-chat-ui` for semantic search capabilities, leveraging the successful tests with Webpack and Turbopack. Research into broader architectural patterns and Turbopack-specific configurations will continue as a background task to ensure long-term stability and best practices.
