## MCP Client Refactoring (req-43) - Completed (May 18, 2025)
- **Objective:** Refactor `src/mcpClient.js` to be a robust MCP client with improved error handling, reconnection, multi-transport support, validation, connection testing, timeout management, resource cleanup, test cases, SDK v1.11.4 compatibility, documentation, extensibility, agent.js integration, and logging.
- **Status:** All planned tasks for `req-43` are complete.
- **Key Outcomes & Changes:**
    - `src/mcpClient.js` was significantly enhanced by adopting a user-provided improved version and further refining it. It now includes:
        - Robust error handling, timeout management, and initial connection retry logic.
        - Support for SSE and Stdio transports.
        - Functions: `invokeMcpTool`, `validateMcpConfigurations`, `testMcpServerConnection`.
        - Integration with `agent.js` for managed Stdio servers (circular dependency resolved by passing `getManagedMcpClient` function).
    - `src/logger.js`: A shared structured JSON logging utility was created and integrated into `src/mcpClient.js` and `src/agent.js`.
    - `src/mcpClient.README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the MCP client was created.
    - `test_mcp_client_refactored.mjs`: A test script was developed to validate `src/mcpClient.js` functionalities.
    - SDK dependencies were updated to `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.11.4`.
- **Persistent SDK Issues (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.11.4` with Node.js v18.20.5 ESM):**
    - **StdioClientTransport:** Connection establishment remains unreliable. `Client.state` often stays `undefined` even if some communication occurs. Server-side errors from Stdio tools are not consistently propagated as client-side exceptions by `client.callTool`.
    - **SSEClientTransport:** Connections frequently fail with `"SSE error: undefined"`.
    - **ESM Server Component Import:** The mock server in tests initially failed due to `McpServer` not being exported from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js`; corrected to use `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js`.
- **Next Steps:** The MCP client refactoring is complete. Future work on MCP will depend on SDK improvements or decisions to implement workarounds for SDK issues. The agent will now proceed based on new user requests or pending higher-level objectives.

## User Preference Update: Task Manager Workflow (May 18, 2025)
- **User Instruction:** The user has indicated they no longer want to be explicitly asked for approval after each task is marked as done when using the Task Manager MCP. They prefer the agent to proceed to the next task directly.
- **Adapted Workflow:** For the current request (`req-43`) and potentially future requests unless otherwise specified by the user, the Task Manager workflow will be adapted to: `mark_task_done` -> `get_next_task`. Explicit approval prompts via `ask_followup_question` for task completion will be omitted.
- **Impact:** This modifies the standard documented Task Manager flow and the guidance in `.clinerules/default-rules.md` for this session.

## MCP Client Refactoring & SDK Investigation Strategy (req-43, Task 1 - May 18, 2025)
- **Objective:** Initiate refactoring of `src/mcpClient.js` and define/execute a strategy to address blocking issues with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.11.4`.
- **Current Status:** Task 1 (`task-209`) of `req-43` is **complete and implicitly approved by user**. SDK version in main project updated to `^1.11.4`; Advanced Chat UI already at `^1.11.4`.
- **Investigation Findings & Strategy for `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` Issues:** (Details as previously logged)
- **Status of Task 1 (`task-209`):** Complete.

---
## MCP Client Refactoring - Task 2 (req-43, `task-210` - May 18, 2025)
- **Objective**: Refactor `src/mcpClient.js` for extensibility.
- **Actions**: (Details as previously logged)
- **Status**: Task 2 (`task-210`) is **complete and implicitly approved by user**.

---

## Advanced Chat UI - Module Resolution Success (May 18, 2025)
- **Objective:** Resolve the "Module not found: Can't resolve '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk'" error in `src/advanced-chat-ui/src/lib/mcp_ui_client.mjs`.
- **Actions Taken:** (Details as previously logged)
- **Outcome:** The `advanced-chat-ui` application started successfully.
- **Next Steps:** Continue with planned tasks. The application is now runnable.

## MCP Client and Agent-Managed Server Enhancements (May 17, 2025)
- **Objective:** Implement a robust and flexible MCP client and an optional system for agent-managed stdio MCP server lifecycles.
- **Key Changes & Implementations:** (Details as previously logged)
- **Testing Blockers (as of May 17, 2025):** (Details as previously logged, noting SDK v1.11.0 was in use then for CLI)
- **Current Status:** Implementation of the MCP client architecture is complete. However, full validation is blocked by the SDK/Stdio issue and SSE server accessibility.
- **Next Steps:** (Details as previously logged)
