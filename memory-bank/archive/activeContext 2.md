# Active Context: AI Agent

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   **Project Initialization:** Setting up the foundational elements of the AI agent project. This includes:
    *   Installing dependencies (`npm install`).
    *   Creating the initial structure and content for the Memory Bank files.
    *   Establishing the `.clinerules` file.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Dependencies Installed:** `youtube-transcript-plus`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `node-fetch` have been installed via `npm install`.
*   **Memory Bank Creation Initiated:**
    *   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` created and populated.
    *   `memory-bank/productContext.md` created and populated.
*   **Decision:** Proceeding with the creation of all core Memory Bank files as per the "Cline's Memory Bank" custom instructions.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).
2.  Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
3.  Create `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
4.  Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
5.  Create `.clinerules` in the project root.
6.  Once initialization is complete, await further instructions from the user.

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

*   Are there any specific initial configurations or settings required for the Python YouTube transcript server (`config/youtube_transcript_server.py`)?
*   What are the immediate tasks the user wants the agent to perform after initialization?
*   Are there any pre-existing `.clinerules` from a global scope that should be incorporated or considered? (User instructions mention a global `.clinerules/` directory).

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed/Inferred)

*   **Structured Documentation:** The user emphasizes detailed and structured documentation through the Memory Bank.
*   **Iterative Process:** The agent is expected to work step-by-step, confirming actions.
*   **Rule-Based Operation:** Adherence to `.clinerules` is critical.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Initial)

*   The project combines Node.js for the main agent logic with Python for specific tasks (YouTube transcripts).
*   MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a key integration point.
*   The Memory Bank is central to the agent's long-term operation and context management.
