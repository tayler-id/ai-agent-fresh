# Progress: AI Agent

## Current Status: Initialization Phase

**Date:** 2025-05-13

The project is currently in its initial setup and foundation-building phase.

## What Works / Completed

*   **Node.js Dependencies Installed:**
    *   `youtube-transcript-plus`
    *   `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
    *   `node-fetch`
    *   Successfully ran `npm install`.
*   **Memory Bank Initialized (Core Files Created):**
    *   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (populated with initial project overview, goals, scope)
    *   `memory-bank/productContext.md` (populated with problem statement, solution, target users, UX goals)
    *   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (populated with current focus, recent changes, next steps)
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (populated with conceptual architecture, initial tech decisions, anticipated patterns)
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` (populated with core technologies, dependencies, dev environment details)

## What's Left to Build / In Progress (Immediate Initialization)

*   **Create `memory-bank/progress.md` (this file).** (Completed upon saving this content)
*   **Create `.clinerules` file in the project root.**
    *   This file needs to be populated with the rules provided in the "USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS" under ".clinerules/" and "thinking.md".
*   **Verify Project Structure and Entry Points:**
    *   Confirm the main entry point for the agent (e.g., `index.js` or `src/agent.js`).
    *   Understand how the Python transcript server (`config/youtube_transcript_server.py`) is intended to be run and integrated.
*   **Basic Agent Workflow:**
    *   Implement the initial logic for the agent to read its Memory Bank upon startup.
    *   Establish a basic loop for receiving user tasks (even if just placeholder).

## Known Issues / Blockers (Current)

*   **`npm error config prefix cannot be changed...`:** An error message appeared during `npm install`. While the installation seemed to proceed, this might indicate an underlying configuration issue with `.npmrc` that could cause problems later.
    *   *Mitigation:* Monitor for any unexpected behavior related to npm or package resolution.
*   **Python Dependencies:** The dependencies for `config/youtube_transcript_server.py` are unknown and not yet managed. This server cannot run without its dependencies installed.
*   **Missing `index.js`:** `package.json` specifies `index.js` as `main`, but this file is not present in the root directory. The actual entry point needs clarification.

## Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **2025-05-13:**
    *   **Decision:** Prioritized creation of all core Memory Bank files as the first step after dependency installation, as per "Cline's Memory Bank" instructions.
    *   **Learning:** The project has a hybrid Node.js/Python nature. The interaction between these two parts needs to be clearly defined.
    *   **Learning:** The `.clinerules` system is a significant driver of agent behavior and must be implemented carefully.
    *   **Observation:** The file structure suggests a separation of concerns, with `src/` for core agent logic and `config/` for specific tool configurations (like the YouTube server).

This document will track the project's progress, milestones, and any shifts in direction.
