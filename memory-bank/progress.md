# Progress and Next Features (Updated May 18, 2025)

## Current Project Status
- **MCP Client Refactoring (req-43) - Completed (May 18, 2025):**
    - `src/mcpClient.js` was significantly refactored and enhanced by adopting a user-provided version and further integrating a shared logger. It now includes improved error handling, timeout management, initial connection retry logic, support for SSE/Stdio, and functions for configuration validation and connection testing.
    - Circular dependency between `agent.js` and `mcpClient.js` was resolved.
    - `src/logger.js` created for shared structured JSON logging.
    - `src/mcpClient.README.md` created with comprehensive documentation.
    - `test_mcp_client_refactored.mjs` developed for testing.
    - **Persistent SDK Issues Noted:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.11.4` continues to show instability with `StdioClientTransport` (client state issues, server error propagation) and `SSEClientTransport` (`SSE error: undefined`) in the Node.js v18 ESM environment.
- **Advanced Chat UI - Module Resolution Success (May 18, 2025):** Resolved "Module not found: Can't resolve '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk'" in `src/advanced-chat-ui/`. The application now starts successfully.
- **Git Repository Reset (May 15, 2025):** Project moved to `ai-agent-fresh` repository.
- **Codebase Audit Completed (May 13, 2025):** Core Memory Bank documents updated.
- **Advanced Chat UI Initiated (May 13, 2025):** Foundational setup for Next.js UI complete.
- **LanceDB Integration with Next.js (Webpack & Turbopack) Successful (May 14, 2025):** LanceDB functional in `advanced-chat-ui`.
- **Memory-Enhanced Tool Chaining (req-34) - Core Mechanism Implemented & Verified (May 16, 2025):** Logic for LLM to query internal memory (`query_memory` tool) is in place.
- **Task Manager MCP Language Issue (May 16, 2025):** Task Manager MCP noted to respond in incorrect language; SSE connection also unreliable.

## Next Features (Revised May 18, 2025)

1.  **Resolve SDK Issues for MCP Functionality (CLI & UI - High Priority but Blocked):**
    *   Further investigate or await fixes for `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.11.4` issues:
        *   `StdioClientTransport` instability (client state, error propagation).
        *   `SSEClientTransport` "SSE error: undefined".
        *   General ESM compatibility, especially for the Advanced Chat UI.
    *   This is critical for reliable MCP tool usage.
2.  **Advanced Chat UI - MCP Integration (Post-SDK Fixes):**
    *   Fully test and debug `mcp_ui_client.mjs` and its integration into `api/chat/route.ts` once SDK issues are resolved.
    *   Address TypeScript errors in `route.ts` related to Vercel AI SDK types.
3.  **Advanced Chat UI - Further Enhancements:**
    *   More sophisticated RAG features (context chunking, UI display of sources).
    *   Dynamic `developerId` handling for personalized memory.
    *   Integration of full analysis capabilities (blueprinting) for URLs.
4.  **Memory Visualization UI - Backend Integration (`src/memory-ui/`):**
    *   Connect the UI's backend API to persistent memory stores.
5.  **Shared Code Management Strategy:**
    *   Implement a robust strategy for sharing code between the main agent and `advanced-chat-ui`.
6.  **Refine Core Agent Workflows, Error Handling, Prompt Engineering (Ongoing).**
7.  **Knowledge Graph Updates (Ongoing).**

## What Is Still Left / Not Yet Fully Implemented or Verified

-   **Reliable MCP Tool Usage (CLI & UI):** Critically dependent on resolving `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` issues. Stdio and SSE transports are currently unreliable due to these SDK problems.
-   **Advanced Chat UI - Full Feature Set:** (As previously documented, with MCP integration pending SDK fixes).
-   **Memory Visualization UI (`src/memory-ui/`) - Full Functionality:** Backend remains mocked.
-   **Shared Code Management:** (As previously documented).
-   **Advanced Agent Autonomy & Task Chaining (CLI & UI):** (As previously documented).
-   **Sophisticated Prompt Engineering:** (As previously documented).
-   **Comprehensive Testing Framework:** `test_mcp_client_refactored.mjs` is a good start for the MCP client, but broader automated testing is needed.
-   (Other items as previously documented: Cloud/Server Deployment, Security, In-depth Help, Extensive External APIs, Performance Optimization, ChromaDB status).

**Summary (Updated May 18, 2025):**
The AI Agent's MCP client (`src/mcpClient.js`) has been significantly refactored for robustness, incorporating features like improved error handling, timeouts, reconnection logic, validation, connection testing, and structured logging. A shared logger (`src/logger.js`) was created. Documentation (`src/mcpClient.README.md`) and test cases (`test_mcp_client_refactored.mjs`) for the MCP client are now in place. The agent's core (`src/agent.js`) was updated to integrate with the refactored client and use the shared logger.

However, the functionality of the MCP client remains severely hampered by persistent issues with the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.11.4`, particularly affecting `StdioClientTransport` (client state inconsistencies, server error propagation issues) and `SSEClientTransport` (`SSE error: undefined`). These SDK issues prevent reliable MCP tool invocation. The Advanced Chat UI's MCP client is also blocked by these SDK problems.

Next steps for MCP will heavily depend on addressing these underlying SDK issues. Other development areas like the Advanced Chat UI enhancements and Memory Visualization UI backend integration can proceed, but any MCP-dependent features will be at risk.
