# Progress and Next Features (Updated May 16, 2025)

## Current Project Status
- **Git Repository Reset (May 15, 2025):** Due to critical issues (failed rebase, conflicts, secret handling problems) in the original `ai-agent` repository, a fresh repository named `ai-agent-fresh` was created at `/Users/tramsay/Desktop/ai-agent-fresh`. All project files were copied to this new repository, and an initial commit was made. The old repository is now deprecated. Development continues in `ai-agent-fresh`.
- **Codebase Audit Completed (May 13, 2025):** Core Memory Bank documents updated.
- **Advanced Chat UI Initiated (May 13, 2025):** Foundational setup for a new Next.js based chat UI (`src/advanced-chat-ui/`) is complete.
- **LanceDB Integration with Next.js (Webpack & Turbopack) Successful (May 14, 2025):**
    - LanceDB (`task-95`) successfully integrated into the `advanced-chat-ui` using `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`.
    - Confirmed working with Webpack (after `webpack.externals` adjustments).
    - Confirmed working with Turbopack (the `serverExternalPackages` setting was sufficient, previous resolution error did not recur).
- **Memory-Enhanced Tool Chaining (req-34) - Core Mechanism Implemented & Verified (May 16, 2025):**
    - Core logic for LLM to request internal memory lookups (`query_memory` tool) during analysis is implemented in `src/agent.js` and `src/llm.js`.
    - Includes orchestration for semantic and hierarchical memory queries and feeding results back to LLM for refinement.
    - Mechanism verified using simulated LLM tool calls. LLM did not spontaneously use the tool in initial naturalistic tests.
- **Next Action (Updated May 16, 2025):** Complete `req-34` (Memory-Enhanced Tool Chaining) by committing and pushing changes. Then, resume high-priority tasks like Advanced Chat UI LanceDB integration.

## Next Features (Revised May 16, 2025)

1.  **Complete "Memory-Enhanced Tool Chaining" (req-34):**
    *   Commit and push all related code changes (`src/agent.js`, `src/llm.js`) and Memory Bank documentation updates (`task-156`).
2.  **Advanced Chat UI - LanceDB RAG & Enhancements (High Priority - Core RAG Implemented):**
    *   **Status:** Core RAG functionality (semantic search via LanceDB in `api/chat` route, results augmenting LLM context) is implemented and tested. Logging has been refined.
    *   **Next Steps for this feature:** Document changes (`task-161`), commit and push (`task-162`).
    *   Monitor for any side effects from the Turbopack warning regarding Webpack configuration. If issues arise, consult Turbopack documentation for specific configurations (`https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo`).
    *   Future enhancements could include more sophisticated context chunking, UI display of RAG sources, and dynamic `developerId` handling in the UI for personalized memory access.
3.  **Research AI Agent Architectures & Native Dependency Solutions (Moderate Priority):**
    *   While the immediate blocker for LanceDB is resolved, this research (`task-98`, `task-99`, `task-100` of `req-23`) remains valuable for long-term best practices, handling other potential native dependencies, and understanding Turbopack-specific configurations beyond `serverExternalPackages`.
4.  **Advanced Chat UI - Other Foundational Enhancements (Post-RAG Commit):**
    *   Further integration of GitHub/YouTube analysis and other core agent features into the chat UI.
5.  **Shared Code Management Strategy:**
    *   Evaluate and implement a robust strategy for sharing code between the main agent and the `advanced-chat-ui`. This remains relevant and may be informed by the research into architectural patterns.
6.  **Memory Visualization UI - Backend Integration (`src/memory-ui/`):**
    *   Connect the UI's backend API to persistent memory stores. This task remains important.
7.  **Local Path Analysis Bug (CLI Agent):**
    *   This task is also secondary but should be addressed.
8.  **Refine Core Agent Workflows, Error Handling, Prompt Engineering (Ongoing):**
    *   Continuously improve prompts (including for `query_memory` if more proactive use is desired).
    *   Enhance error handling and overall agent robustness.
9.  **Knowledge Graph Updates (Ongoing):**
    *   To reflect architectural changes and new feature implementations.

## What Is Still Left / Not Yet Fully Implemented or Verified

This list reflects features that are either not started, partially implemented without full integration, or need significant refinement.

-   **Advanced Chat UI - Full Feature Set:**
    *   **Semantic Search/Vector DB Integration (`task-95` related):** Core RAG (semantic search augmenting LLM context in `api/chat`) is implemented.
        *   *Still Left:* More advanced RAG features (e.g., sophisticated context chunking strategies, UI display/sourcing of retrieved context, dynamic `developerId` handling for personalized memory access in UI), full analysis (cloning, blueprinting) for URLs, LangChain.js integration.
    *   Dynamic UI elements and sophisticated animations.
    *   Display of complex analysis results (blueprints).
-   **Memory Visualization UI (`src/memory-ui/`) - Full Functionality:** The UI backend is currently mocked. Full CRUD operations against persistent memory are NOT implemented for the UI.
-   **Shared Code Management:** Current solution for `github.js` (copying) is a workaround. A robust monorepo strategy (e.g., local packages, npm/yarn workspaces) for sharing code between `ai-agent/src` and `src/advanced-chat-ui` is needed for better maintainability.
-   **Advanced Agent Autonomy & Task Chaining (CLI & UI):** Beyond the new `query_memory` mechanism, no broader system for breaking down high-level goals or autonomous task execution beyond initial LLM blueprinting.
-   **Sophisticated Prompt Engineering (Beyond Initial Chat UI Setup & `query_memory`):** Current prompt generation for CLI is template-based; advanced dynamic adaptation using full context (semantic search, hierarchical memory, profiles) is a next step for both CLI and the new UI.
-   **Robust MCP Tool Usage (CLI & UI):** MCP client exists, but its practical application (e.g., for YouTube transcripts) is not fully integrated or prioritized for either interface. The role of `config/youtube_transcript_server.py` needs clarification or deprecation if `youtube-transcript-plus` is the sole method.
-   **Comprehensive Testing Framework:** No automated testing, validation, or evaluation framework for agent outputs or module integrations.
-   **Cloud/Server Deployment & Multi-User Support:** Agent is CLI-focused; no infrastructure for cloud deployment or multi-user scenarios.
-   **Security/Access Control:** No specific authentication/authorization beyond GitHub PATs for private repos.
-   **In-depth Documentation/Help System:** While Memory Bank exists, no in-agent help or comprehensive user guides.
-   **Extensive External API Integrations (beyond core):** Limited to DeepSeek, OpenAI, YouTube (via library), and GitHub (via CLI).
-   **Performance Optimization for Scale:** Current implementations are functional but not necessarily optimized for very large datasets or high-throughput scenarios.
-   **Alternative ChromaDB Vector Memory:** Its status is secondary to LanceDB; likely to be deprecated or kept for historical reference only.

**Summary (Updated May 16, 2025):**
The AI Agent, in the `ai-agent-fresh` repository, has a solid foundation with diverse analysis capabilities and multiple memory systems. The "Memory-Enhanced Tool Chaining" feature's core mechanism for the CLI agent is implemented and verified. The Advanced Chat UI now has a functional core RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capability using LanceDB semantic search integrated into its `api/chat` route, with refined logging. Immediate next steps involve documenting and committing these Chat UI RAG updates, then proceeding with other roadmap items. The Memory Bank documentation is being actively updated.
