# Progress and Next Features (Post-Codebase Audit - May 13, 2025)

## Current Project Status
- **Codebase Audit Completed (May 13, 2025):** Core Memory Bank documents updated.
- **Advanced Chat UI Initiated (May 13, 2025):** Foundational setup for a new Next.js based chat UI (`src/advanced-chat-ui/`) is complete.
- **LanceDB Integration with Next.js (Webpack & Turbopack) Successful (May 14, 2025):**
    - LanceDB (`task-95`) successfully integrated into the `advanced-chat-ui` using `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`.
    - Confirmed working with Webpack (after `webpack.externals` adjustments).
    - Confirmed working with Turbopack (the `serverExternalPackages` setting was sufficient, previous resolution error did not recur).
- **Next Action (Resumed):** Proceed with full LanceDB semantic search integration in the `advanced-chat-ui` and continue feature development. Research into broader architectural patterns for native modules will continue at a moderate priority.

## Actually Completed & Implemented Features (Based on Code Audit & Recent Work)

-   **Core Agent Logic (`src/agent.js`):**
    -   CLI for YouTube, GitHub (public/private with PAT), and local project URL/path input.
    -   Orchestration of analysis workflows.
    -   Configuration loading (`config.json`, environment variables).
    -   Basic Express.js backend for Memory UI (currently with mock in-memory data for API).
-   **Content Sourcing:**
    -   YouTube transcript fetching (`src/youtube.js` via `youtube-transcript-plus`).
    -   GitHub repository cloning and content extraction (`src/github.js` via `git` CLI, `glob`, `.agentinclude` support).
    -   Local project content extraction (similar logic in `src/agent.js` and `src/github.js`).
-   **LLM Interaction (`src/llm.js`):**
    -   Interaction with DeepSeek API.
    -   Generation of detailed JSON "Improvement and Re-implementation Blueprints."
    -   Support for follow-up questions/refinements.
-   **Prompt Formatting (`src/promptGenerator.js`):**
    -   Conversion of LLM JSON blueprints to Markdown files and console prompts.
-   **Memory Systems:**
    -   **Simple Key-Value Memory (`src/memory.js`):** File-based (`memory-store.json`).
    -   **Hierarchical Memory (`src/hierarchicalMemory.js`):** File-based for session, project, global layers (`memory-hierarchy/`).
    -   **Semantic Vector Memory (LanceDB):**
        -   OpenAI embedding generation (`vector-memory/embeddingProvider.js`).
        -   LanceDB interface (`src/lancedb.js`) for table creation, data insertion, and vector search.
        -   Higher-level `LanceVectorMemory` class (`vector-memory/lanceVectorMemory.js`) integrating embedding and LanceDB operations.
    -   *(Alternative ChromaDB vector memory implementation also exists in `vector-memory/vectorMemory.js` but LanceDB appears to be the active/primary one based on recent memory bank descriptions before this audit).*
-   **Personalization & Context:**
    -   Developer profile management (`src/developerProfile.js`) storing patterns/preferences in `developer-profiles/`.
    -   Dynamic context window construction for LLMs (`src/contextWindowManager.js`).
-   **Memory Visualization UI (Partial - `src/memory-ui/`):**
    -   React frontend (`App.js`) for browsing, searching, editing memory/profiles.
    -   Backend API in `agent.js` is currently a MOCK and does NOT connect to persistent memory stores.
-   **MCP Client (`src/mcpClient.js`):**
    -   Client for invoking tools on an external MCP server.
-   **Advanced Chat UI (Foundational Setup - `src/advanced-chat-ui/`):**
    -   Next.js application created (`src/advanced-chat-ui/`) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router.
    -   Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`, `@ai-sdk/openai`) installed and integrated.
    -   Basic chat page (`src/app/chat/page.tsx`) using `useChat` hook.
    -   Backend API route (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`) connecting to DeepSeek LLM (via OpenAI provider compatibility) and streaming responses.
    -   Initial URL detection (GitHub/YouTube) in API route, modifying system prompt for LLM acknowledgment.
    -   Resolved module import issues for `github.js` by copying it to `src/advanced-chat-ui/src/lib/github.js` and installing `glob` as a local dependency.
    -   NPM cache configuration issues diagnosed and resolved for the main project.
    -   **LanceDB Integration (`task-95`):** Successfully tested with Webpack and Turbopack (May 14, 2025). The `serverExternalPackages: ['@lancedb/lancedb']` setting in `next.config.ts` was key. Webpack also required `webpack.externals`. The Turbopack `Error: could not resolve "@lancedb/lancedb-darwin-arm64"` did **not** reappear.

## Next Features (Revised May 14, 2025)

1.  **Advanced Chat UI - LanceDB Integration & Enhancements (RESUMED - HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
    *   **Objective:** Fully integrate LanceDB semantic search into the `api/chat` route. Ensure search results are correctly processed and used to augment LLM context (RAG).
    *   Refine the logging for LanceDB search results in `route.ts` to be more concise if needed.
    *   Proceed with `task-95` and related UI feature development that depends on semantic search.
    *   Monitor for any side effects from the Turbopack warning regarding Webpack configuration. If issues arise, consult Turbopack documentation for specific configurations (`https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo`).

2.  **Research AI Agent Architectures & Native Dependency Solutions (Adjusted Priority):**
    *   While the immediate blocker for LanceDB is resolved, this research (`task-98`, `task-99`, `task-100` of `req-23`) remains valuable for long-term best practices, handling other potential native dependencies, and understanding Turbopack-specific configurations beyond `serverExternalPackages`. It can proceed at a moderate priority or be deferred if UI development takes precedence.

3.  **Advanced Chat UI - Other Foundational Enhancements:**
    *   Further integration of GitHub/YouTube analysis and other features can now proceed more confidently.

4.  **Shared Code Management Strategy:**
    *   This remains relevant and may be informed by the research into architectural patterns.

5.  **Memory Visualization UI - Backend Integration (`src/memory-ui/`):**
    *   This task remains important but is secondary to resolving the core architecture for semantic search.

6.  **Local Path Analysis Bug (CLI Agent):**
    *   This task is also secondary to the new research initiative.

7.  **Refine Core Agent Workflows, Error Handling, Prompt Engineering (Ongoing):**
    *   These are continuous improvement tasks.

8.  **Knowledge Graph Updates (Ongoing):**
    *   To reflect architectural changes post-research.

## What Is Still Left / Not Yet Fully Implemented or Verified

This list reflects features that are either not started, partially implemented without full integration, or need significant refinement.

-   **Advanced Chat UI - Full Feature Set:**
    *   **Semantic Search/Vector DB Integration (`task-95`):** Integration is now unblocked and in progress. Full RAG capabilities need to be built out.
    *   Full analysis (cloning, blueprinting) for URLs is not yet integrated.
    *   LangChain.js integration for RAG, tools, agents.
    *   Dynamic UI elements and sophisticated animations.
    *   Display of complex analysis results (blueprints).
-   **Memory Visualization UI (`src/memory-ui/`) - Full Functionality:** The UI backend is currently mocked. Full CRUD operations against persistent memory are NOT implemented for the UI.
-   **Shared Code Management:** Current solution for `github.js` (copying) is a workaround. A robust monorepo strategy (e.g., local packages, npm/yarn workspaces) for sharing code between `ai-agent/src` and `src/advanced-chat-ui` is needed for better maintainability. This may be informed by the architectural research.
-   **Advanced Agent Autonomy & Task Chaining (CLI & UI):** No system for breaking down high-level goals or autonomous task execution beyond initial LLM blueprinting.
-   **Sophisticated Prompt Engineering (Beyond Initial Chat UI Setup):** Current prompt generation for CLI is template-based; advanced dynamic adaptation using full context (semantic search, hierarchical memory, profiles) is a next step for both CLI and the new UI.
-   **Robust MCP Tool Usage (CLI & UI):** MCP client exists, but its practical application (e.g., for YouTube transcripts) is not fully integrated or prioritized for either interface.
-   **Comprehensive Testing Framework:** No automated testing, validation, or evaluation framework for agent outputs or module integrations.
-   **Cloud/Server Deployment & Multi-User Support:** Agent is CLI-focused; no infrastructure for cloud deployment or multi-user scenarios.
-   **Security/Access Control:** No specific authentication/authorization beyond GitHub PATs for private repos.
-   **In-depth Documentation/Help System:** While Memory Bank exists, no in-agent help or comprehensive user guides.
-   **Extensive External API Integrations (beyond core):** Limited to DeepSeek, OpenAI, YouTube (via library), and GitHub (via CLI).
-   **Performance Optimization for Scale:** Current implementations are functional but not necessarily optimized for very large datasets or high-throughput scenarios.
-   **Alternative ChromaDB Vector Memory:** Its current status and integration level relative to LanceDB need clarification if it's intended for future use.

**Summary (Post-Audit):**
The AI Agent has a strong foundation with multiple analysis capabilities, sophisticated memory systems (including functional LanceDB semantic search), developer personalization, and a partially implemented Memory UI. The immediate focus post-audit is to make the Memory UI fully functional by connecting its backend to the persistent data stores, followed by enhancing the agent's intelligence through advanced contextual prompt engineering. The Memory Bank documentation is now significantly more aligned with the actual codebase.
